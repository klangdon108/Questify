Questify (HTML/CSS/JS) - v6
================================

Changes requested:
- Renamed app to Questify (UI + manifest + title)
- Added Settings -> "Test Trophies" button:
  * Creates 1 side quest per tier (Iron..Platinum) and seeds completions so each trophy shows that tier.
  * Creates main quest "possibilities" list; only Platinum shows as completed (others locked) for contrast.
- Level-up: louder/longer trumpet fanfare + full-screen confetti burst
- Removed all preloaded side quests, main quests, rewards, and achievements from defaults (starts empty).

Notes:
- Test Trophies replaces your current quests/rewards/log while testing.
- Use Reset ALL data to clear everything.


v7 updates:
- Lifetime HUD: XP + Gold + SP
- Seamless scrolling background (fixed attachment)
- Trophy icon + vibrant tier materials
- 5s full-screen level-up celebration overlay (replaces confetti)
